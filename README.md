Procedural Generation of Terrain with Hydraulic Erosion and City Placement

When the user presses the left mouse button, the hydraulic erosion process stops,
and if all the conditions are met, buildings and a road are generated accordingly 
(in some cases, the buildings are not generated because there is no suitable place to add them in the world we created).
